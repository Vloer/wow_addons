# TODO
## Make sure addon does not reset in the following scenarios:
    - Player reloads during active challenge mode
    - Player leaves and re-enters during active challenge mode
    - Other player leaves and rejoins party during active challenge mode
    - Other player leaves party but dungeon is still finished

## Add death recording
    - Register combat log event
      - Who was killed
      - By what
      - During what encounter (boss/trash)

## Try to detect reasons for a key failing
    - Start with player left, over time

## Add GUI 

## Add more stats

## Allow filtering on multiple key/values
    - For example player and dungeon

## Add format to log (similar to python logs)
